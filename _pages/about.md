# About Me

# 🎉 Welcome to My GitHub!

👋 Hi there! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/). My research interests revolve around **computer vision**, **generative AI**, and **diffusion models**, with a special focus on **controllable video generation**. 🎥✨

🎓 I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bingkun Bao](https://www.scholat.com/bkbao.cn) at the [Multimedia Cognitive Computing Lab](https://mcclab.njupt.edu.cn/main.htm). Together, we explore cutting-edge research in multimedia and artificial intelligence. 🤖🖼️

📩 If you have any questions about my projects or want to collaborate, feel free to drop me an email at **2024010131@njupt.edu.cn**. I’m always happy to connect and share ideas! 💡🤝

🔗 Let’s make something awesome together!
